The turbo-devel package contains Turbo specific libraries, headers,
developer documentation and examples.

The package is always available at www.bladox.com.

To develop Turbo specific packages it is necessary to have following
packages installed:
- GCC - standard gcc configured for AVR
- binutils - modified binutils to support Turbo binary application format.

Please see the doc/html/turbo-devel-manual/index.html for more information
on how to install these packages.

You may use the included examples freely without any limitations.

In your project the only configuration to set is the TURBO_DIR variable
pointing to the turbo-devel location. Either modify the Makefile or use 
"export TURBO_DIR=where_is_turbo-devel_installed".
